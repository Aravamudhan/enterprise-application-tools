This repo is work in progress. I am going to be creating implementations of APIs and concepts from the documentations
of spring. This repo will be helpful if you are going through the related documentation and need 
quick working examples of the APIs. 

#firstmvc project
This application is a starter for spring mvc.

#springcore
The examples are from the [reference documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/).
