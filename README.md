# enterprise-application-tools - A repository for application development in Java
This repo is work in progress. I am going to be creating implementations of APIs and concepts from the documentations
of various frameworks/libraries. This repo will be helpful if you are going through the related documentation and need 
quick working examples of the APIs. Feel free to experiment.
