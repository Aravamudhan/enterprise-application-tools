# enterprise-application-tools - A repository for application development in Java
This repo is work in progress. I am going to be creating implementations of APIs and concepts from the documentations
of various frameworks/libraries. This repo will be helpful if you are going through the related documentation and need 
quick working examples of the APIs. 

#firstmvc project
This application is a starter for spring mvc.

#springcore
The examples are from the [reference documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/).
